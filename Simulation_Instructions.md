1. Go live in your browser from index.html
2. Enter your browser console
3. From your browser console, run nSimulations(n, optimalOpponent)
  * n = number of games you want to simulate
  * optimalOpponent = boolean value =>
    * true plays against opponent using minimax algorithm
    * false plays against opponent making random moves
4. Expectations
  * Against a random opponent, the AI will never lose
  * Against an oopitmal opponent (both parties use minimax agorithm), 100% of the results will be a tie
